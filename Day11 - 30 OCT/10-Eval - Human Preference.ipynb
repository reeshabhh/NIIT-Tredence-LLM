    "#### Human Preference Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture subjective human preference, we first set up the evaluation project using our specialized and highly-vetted Alignerr workforce, with consensus set to three human labelers per data row, allowing us to tap into a network of expert raters to evaluate image outputs across several key criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alignment with Prompt\n",
    "Raters assessed how well each generated image matched the given text prompt on a scale of high, medium, or low. For example, for the prompt \"A red apple on a wooden table\":\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High**: Image shows a clear, realistic red apple on a wooden table\n",
    "- **Medium**: Image shows an apple, but it's green or the table isn't clearly wooden\n",
    "- **Low**: Image shows an unrelated scene\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Photorealism\n",
    "This criterion evaluates how closely the image resembled a real photograph:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High**: Realistic lighting, textures, and proportions\n",
    "- **Medium**: Somewhat realistic but with slight issues in shadows or textures\n",
    "- **Low**: Cartoonish or artificial appearance\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detail\n",
    "Raters then determined the level of detail and overall clarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High**: Fine details visible (e.g., individual leaves, fabric textures)\n",
    "- **Medium**: Major elements clear, but finer details somewhat lacking\n",
    "- **Low**: Overall blurry or lacking significant detail\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Artifacts\n",
    "Finally, raters identified any visible artifacts, distortions, or errors, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unnatural distortions in objects or backgrounds\n",
    "- Misplaced or floating elements\n",
    "- Inconsistent lighting or shadows\n",
    "- Unnatural repeating patterns\n",
    "- Blurred or pixelated areas\n"
